This my project in NLP course in my university - Ho Chi Minh University of Technology ( HCMUT ) 

The requirements of professor for this project:
I. Introduction

In Labs 5 and 6, everyone was provided with sentiment datasets used in the VLSP competition. Additionally, code examples were given for:

Using CNN for sentiment analysis
Using RNN and LSTM for sentiment analysis
Pre-trained Word2Vec model using CBOW
II. Requirements

a. Propose and experiment with at least 3 methods (your own proposed method will be encouraged):

CNN
LSTM
Combining CNN and LSTM 
The first two methods can reuse sample code or be improved to achieve better results (bonus will be given).

b. Present the experimental results and compare between the methods.

III. Submission
